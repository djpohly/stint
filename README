stint - simple, suckless-style color grabber for X11

When run, waits for the user to press the left mouse button.  As long as the
button is held down, it will continue to print the color under the pointer in
decimal "RRR GGG BBB" format.  If a `-x` flag is provided, output will instead
be printed in "#RRGGBB" format.  Exits when the button is released.

Dependencies: Xlib
